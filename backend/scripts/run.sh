# Common command runner. Every operational command for this backend (migrate,
# seed, one-off data fixes, ...) lives here so Docker and humans run the exact
# same thing. Add new commands as a function + a case entry below.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/run.sh <command> [args...]
#   setup               migrate + seed (what the container runs on start)
#   migrate             resolve duplicates, then `alembic upgrade head` (with DB-ready retries)
#   makemigration MSG   alembic revision --autogenerate -m MSG
#   seed                create the admin account
#   resolve-duplicates  auto-resolve duplicate member nid/mobile/email
#   migrate-member-ids  [--apply] rewrite member IDs
#   repair-document-paths [args]
#   serve               start uvicorn on $PORT (default 9090)
